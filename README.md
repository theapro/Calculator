# Black & White Calculator UI

A modern calculator UI built with React and Tailwind CSS, featuring a black-and-white-only theme with no box shadows or colors. Fully responsive, with smooth button animations and large monospaced display.

## Features

- Black-and-white flat design (no colors, no box shadows)
- Responsive, centered layout
- Grid-based button layout with consistent spacing
- Large monospaced display area
- Button hover (`hover:opacity-80`) and click (`active:scale-95`) animations
- Smooth transitions (`transition-all duration-200`)
- Only React and Tailwind CSS required

## Usage

1. Copy `Calculator.jsx` and `App.jsx` into your React project (`src/`).
2. Ensure Tailwind CSS is set up (see `tailwind.config.js`).
3. Import and use `<Calculator />` in your app.

```
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

Add Tailwind to your CSS entrypoint (e.g., `index.css`):

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
